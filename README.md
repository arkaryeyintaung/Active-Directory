# Active-Directory

Active Directory (AD) is a directory service, which means that it is a database containing information about objects within a network and the relationships among them, as well as the services that implement that information.

Contains the various vital credentials about your environment such as what users and computers are there and who has access to so much. For instance, the general database may include hundred user accounts where each accounts contains information such as the users job, phone and password. It will also document their permissions.

The services contain much of the activities that occur in your IT environment. Specifically, they ensure that each user is indeed who he or she claims to be (authentication, which often involves checking the user ID and password the user enters) and enable the user to use only the data he or she is permitted to (authorization).
